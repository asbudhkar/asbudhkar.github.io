The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011. The competition is designed to allow for participation without special domain knowledge. 

The benchmark has the following properties:
Single-image, multi-class classification problem
More than 40 classes
More than 50,000 images in total
Large, lifelike database

Kaggle competition on the The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark [http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news] was conducted as a part of Computer Vision class. 
Trained multiple models like ResNet, DenseNet, Spatial Transform Network in order to obtain best performance on test set. Implemented the CNN models along with requisite data preprocessing mechanisms (rotation, scaling and translation) to obtain more accurate sign detection.
Achieved an accuracy of 99.06% with Spatial Transform Netwrok variant on the final test set portion.
