                Data plays a crutial role in various businesses like finance, health-care, e-commerce, etc. The process of data capture, retrieval, processing and storing has become challenging due to the huge amaount and large variety of data available which makes it exciting for me. I have gained diverse skills in Data Science including Deep Learning, Big data application development, Computer Vision and Natural Language processing. I am interested to work on applicative research in these domains. I have end-to end experience with machine learning, big data projects which includes data collection, model training and evaluation of results.
